I'm a second-year computer science PhD student at EPFL in the Theory Lab. My advisor is Prof. Ola Svensson. Broadly, I work with approximation algorithms, including online and randomized algorithms.

I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo (majors: Combinatorics and Optimization, Pure Mathematics).
