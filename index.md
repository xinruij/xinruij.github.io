# Xinrui Jia
(shin-ray)

I recently graduated with a PhD in computer science from EPFL. Broadly, I worked on approximation algorithms and discrete optimization and I have done some work on clustering. Currently, I am working as a data scientist implementing scheduling algorithms at a start-up. I am teaching myself applied machine learning to augment my skills and to take on new projects in my work.

I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo (majors: Combinatorics and Optimization, Pure Mathematics).
